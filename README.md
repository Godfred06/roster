# roster
this is the final project for the second course of Python 3 programming (Functions, Files and Dictionaries)
The code takes a tweet and check to see the number of postive and negative words in the tweet.
Net score is calculated as the number of positive words minus the number of negative words.
After the positive, negative, net score, number of replies and the number of retweets are written into a new csv file
The files positive_words.txt and negative_words.txt and also the csv file containing the tweets are not included in this project
This is due to the fact that, the course required coding on their online platform and the files were not avaiable to download
